# The-Segfault-Sorcerers-STATATHON-2025

1. Background & Origin of the Project

Context:
The National Sample Survey (NSS) is one of India’s most critical statistical operations, collecting unit-level microdata about households, individuals, and enterprises. This data is used by ministries, researchers, and policy makers for evidence-based decisions.

Problem Trigger:
Over the years, there has been growing concern that even “anonymised” datasets can be re-identified, especially with today’s AI-driven data mining capabilities.
Example: Combining NSS data with publicly available voter rolls or telecom records could re-identify individuals despite names being removed.

Historical Handling:

Traditionally, NSS data has been anonymised using basic suppression and coding (removing names, masking IDs, aggregating sensitive categories).

Encryption was mainly used during transmission, not in stored datasets.

Users signed legal agreements, but technical safeguards were minimal compared to modern standards.

3. The Gap

Modern AI-powered re-identification can bypass old anonymisation.

No automated, real-time threat modeling exists for NSS data before release.

Limited feedback loop — once data is released, no monitoring of re-identification attempts.

Encryption isn’t adaptive to different sensitivity levels within the same dataset.

4. Our Proposed Approach

We introduce an AI-driven, automated “Safe Data Tool” that:

Threat Modeling Before Release

Uses AI to simulate all known attack vectors (linkage, attribute disclosure, reconstruction).

Assigns a Privacy Risk Score to each dataset before sharing.

Multi-Layered Privacy Techniques

Adaptive K-Anonymity + L-Diversity tuned per dataset.

Differential Privacy noise injection for statistical tables.

Homomorphic Encryption for certain sensitive computations.

Synthetic Data Generation for high-risk variables.

Automated Workflow (n8n.io-based)

Data ingestion → Validation → Threat modeling → Privacy transformation → Secure release.

Logs all steps on an immutable ledger (Blockchain) for audit.

Continuous Learning

Every new privacy breach attempt logged and fed back into the AI threat model.

Keeps the system evolving against new attack strategies.

5. Why This is a Step-Change

Moves from static anonymisation to dynamic, threat-adaptive privacy.

Integrates AI/ML threat simulation, something not done in previous NSS processes.

Combines multiple privacy techniques into a unified decision engine.

Automated compliance — reducing dependency on manual expert judgment alone.
